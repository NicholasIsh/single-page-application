The top of the page is adorned with a semi-transparent navbar, featuring a logo and links to various sections of the site. The navbarâ€™s slight transparency allows it to blend into the page seamlessly, while a gold underline highlights the currently active section, enhancing navigability.\nGallery Page:\nThe gallery begins with a bold title atop an image reminiscent of a classic sculpture gallery setting. Below, three images allow users to visually traverse through the gallery via interactive elements, simulating a virtual tour of Renaissance masterpieces. As users navigate, the centerpiece image is flanked by smaller images, with detailed descriptions and a larger image of the sculpture appearing below the gallery, enriching the visitor\'s engagement and understanding.\nDesign and Blog Pages:\nBoth pages maintain a consistent header layout, with text and visuals that align with the overall site design. The Design page mirrors the Gallery setup, focusing on aesthetic principles, while the Blog serves as a platform for articles and discussions related to Renaissance art and design philosophy.\nTheory Page:\nDiverging slightly, the Theory page offers a more scholarly approach. Text is offset to the left, creating a visual hierarchy that allows for detailed discussions and analyses. Images to the right complement the text, providing visual references that enhance comprehension and engagement.'
