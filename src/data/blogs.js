      title: 'Week 3',
      content: 'This week we began some revision and I must say it is much needed as I feel I have become a bit rusty over the break and need to revitalize my skills especially as we are going to begin working on new concepts like React. \nNet art has been a difficult concept to wrap my head around as I\'ve been struggling to understand where its boundaries lie. What makes art net art? Does simply posting a picture on a website count as net art? Why are certain things on the internet considered net art or just art that is hosted on the internet? These are the questions I\'ve been asking myself. After some deliberation and research I think I\'ve gained a better understanding. Net art is more of a symbiotic relationship between artistic expression and its digital medium. What I particularly like about net art is how artists manipulate digital tools to challenge traditional perceptions of art and interaction creating sometimes bizarre yet intriguing artworks. On the other hand, the impermanence and often ephemeral nature of web art, where works can disappear with a server shutdown or become incompatible with new technologies, leaves a lingering sense of fragility and loss that challenges my conventional understanding of art\'s “permanence”. \nHowever I noticed that some aspects of net art can be disorienting like the overwhelming sensory experiences in works like "The Legible City" by Jeffrey Shaw, which, while innovative, sometimes sacrifice user engagement for avant-garde expression. Nevertheless, the dynamic and evolving canvas of net art continues to intrigue me, offering a unique perspective into the future of artistic exploration and the ongoing dialogue between human creativity and digital potential.'

      content: 'Starting to learn React for JavaScript has been a challenging but rewarding experience. React, with its focus on building interactive user interfaces, requires a different approach compared to traditional web development methods. It introduces concepts like JSX, components, and state management, which initially seemed complex. However, as I\'ve continued to explore React, I\'ve started to see its effectiveness in creating dynamic web experiences. \nAt the same time, I\'ve been researching net art, focusing on Out4Pizza.com. This site mixes humor, web culture, and digital aesthetics in an interactive way. It transforms viewers into participants, showcasing the interactive essence of net art. This exploration has not only expanded my understanding of the artistic capabilities of web technologies but has also drawn connections to commercial web development. \nThe combination of learning React and exploring net art like Out4Pizza.com has broadened my view of what\'s possible with web technologies. React’s approach to managing components has shown me how web elements can work together seamlessly, similar to how each part of Out4Pizza.com contributes to its overall impact. This journey has sharpened both my technical skills and my appreciation for the artistic side of web development.'

      content: 'My progress in developing my site using React has been both educational and challenging. I have successfully implemented a variety of features, from dynamic image galleries to blog pages, each utilizing React’s efficient re-rendering and state management capabilities. I have attempted to smoothly integrate animations and manage transitions between different states of the application showcases the power of React. The use of components and hooks has enhanced the site\'s responsiveness and interactivity, making it not just functional but also engaging. \nI\'m currently brainstorming an internet art project inspired by Out4Pizza.com\'s digital flair and the classical elegance of Renaissance marble statues. This idea explores the contrast between the modern, transient nature of digital art and the enduring, solemn beauty of marble sculptures. Although I haven’t started any prep work and the project\'s details are still unclear, the theme focuses on merging historical art with contemporary digital culture. \nRegarding AI and art, it\'s a theme that really captivates me. AI can push the limits of traditional creativity, creating art that is not only made by machines but also interactive, possibly changing based on viewer interaction. Although I have no clue how to make a proper AI for my project I was thinking I could dynamically adjust the artwork based on user feedback, such as altering the expressions of digital marble statues or their backgrounds in real-time. This approach would challenge our usual views on art, blurring the lines between the artist, the artwork, and the audience.'
