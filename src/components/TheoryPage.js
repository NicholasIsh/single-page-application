                <h1>Critical Analysis Essay on Net/Web Art</h1>  
                <p>The modern internet of our age has emerged not just as a tool for communication, a space for information and art but has become a medium of artistic expression.
                        Net/web art utilises the internet as its canvas, gallery and medium which allows for a unique perspective on how contemporary art has transcended traditional 
                        boundaries and has the ability to engage with a global audience so long as they have an internet connection. I intend to explore the nature of the internet as 
                        an artistic medium through a focused analysis of the archive of artworks “out_4_pizza” hosted on out4pizza.com created by Laura Brothers using various theoretical 
                        frameworks to critically examine and engage with the artworks' depth and aesthetic. Keeping in mind the broader context of net/web art and online digital culture, 
                        I will also consider the historical influences and contemporary relevance of such developments in this field of art, articulating a comprehensive understanding of 
                        how the internet reshapes our perception of art and its creation in the current digital landscape. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Before I begin my analysis of outforpizza.com I would like to explore the internet as an artistic medium inorder to gain a better understanding of net/web art. 
                        The evolution of the internet as a platform of artistic expression is a significant event in art as it marks the departure from more conventional mediums although 
                        initially the internet served primarily as a means for communication and data exchange as technology advanced artists began exploring its potential to create and 
                        disseminate art that can interact with a global audience in real time. The first creations of net/web art can be traced back to to the 1980s and 90s when artists 
                        began experimenting with the internet and its capabilities in art exploration which saw the development of various forms of digital art like cyberart, interactive 
                        art and eventually leading to net/web art using the internet as its medium. Projects such as “The Thing” and “Net.art” kicked off this movement by utilising the 
                        internet's ability to host interactive and collaborative art projects that were impossible in physical spaces that would have been otherwise impossible in a physical space.
                    </p>
                    <p>The unique traits of the internet as a medium like its interactivity, connectivity and its pervasiveness offers distinct advantages for artistic creation with its immense 
                        interactivity as its most transformative feature. This allows artworks to be designed to change in reaction to the viewer's interactions with it creating a dynamic form 
                        of expression that can evolve over time. The internet's connectivity allows for the art to be accessed instantly all around the globe and reach a much broader audience 
                        than traditional physical artworks possibly could as they only exist in a single space like a gallery. Another unique trait of the internet as a medium is its ability to 
                        host multimedia content allowing artists to combine text, images and sounds which create a rich and multi-sensory experience making the nature of net/web art more complex 
                        and layered, engaging with multiple sense simultaneously for a more immersive experience that conventional static displays would. However the challenges that net/web art 
                        face is the fast paced and fleeting nature of the internet meaning that artworks can be lost overtime as the overwhelming amount of content on the internet can make it 
                        challenging for an individual to be seen and retain an audience's attention. “Out_4_pizza” is a LiveJournal blog where Laura Brothers posts digital paintings and animated 
                        gifs with each post containing one or several images labelled only with a brief title and displayed against a black background. "Out_4_pizza" serves as a good example of 
                        net/web art as it utilises the internet's unique abilities to push the boundaries of contemporary artistic expression. "Out_4_pizza" is described as a "rigorous exploration 
                        of the particular affordances of 'painting' with the computer for an online audience" (NET ART ANTHOLOGY: out_4_pizza, 2016). Brothers’ approach to digital painting shows 
                        awareness of how digital platforms can influence artistic expression and viewer engagement with each image's cryptic title and the blogs minimalist aesthetic shifting the 
                        viewer's attention entirely on the artworks themself, inviting the viewer to deeply contemplate the images’ intricate details and abstract compositions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Brothers leverages the digital medium inorder to create visual effects that are unique to computer displays through the use of pixel-perfect compositions allowing for moiré 
                        patterns to appear from scrolling or resizing the webpage (NET ART ANTHOLOGY: out_4_pizza, 2016). This speaks to me as I also made use of moiré patterns on a previous data 
                        artwork which I titled Helios. The manipulation of digital artefacts emphasises the interaction between the artwork and its way of presenting arts dynamic nature with its 
                        aesthetic being distinctly digital using the computer screen not just as a canvas but also as an active participant in the artworks visual display, encouraging viewers to 
                        consider how digital interfaces meditate and communicate their perception of art. Using a more technical analysis, Brothers makes use of basic consumer-grade software tools 
                        like Photoshop and MS Paint which shows the accessible nature and DIY ethos of digital art. Brothers’ work "often involve a shifting interplay between hard-edged pixel fields 
                        that reinforce the digital grid of the computer screen and organic, brushlike gestural marks made with a computer mouse" (NET ART ANTHOLOGY: out_4_pizza, 2016). This reflects 
                        a fusion of precise control which digital tools like Photoshop offer with the spontaneity and fluidity of traditional physical painting methods. The LiveJournal platform 
                        itself plays a critical role in how the works are experienced as changes in the platforms image compression and resizing have an influence on how and when these artworks 
                        achieve their intended visual clarity. Brothers has over the years adapted her presentation strategies to ensure that her digital paintings maintain their intended effect 
                        which serves as a demonstration of her commitment to the medium and its evolving nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>Net/web art offers a unique exploration of computational creativity as can be seen in  "out_4_pizza," and presents an opportunity to bridge the gap between technology 
                        and human expression. Smith and Leymarie (2017) discuss the notion of machines not merely as tools in artistic creation but as artists themselves who are capable of 
                        "begin[ning] to speak comfortably of the machine as artist" and potentially enhancing "aesthetic sensitivity" (Smith & Leymarie, 2017). Aligning closely with the 
                        conceptual basis of "out_4_pizza," where digital tools do not just act as a space to create and display art but actively shape the creation process. Colton and 
                        Wiggins (2012) emphasise that computational systems, by assuming "particular responsibilities," show behaviours that "unbiased observers would deem to be creative" 
                        (Colton & Wiggins, 2012). This is important to consider when analysing "out_4_pizza," as not only does it highlight the projects integration of digital tools to produce 
                        art but also to change how art is conceptualised and interacted with online with the ability to of these systems to innovate aesthetically and technically reflecting a 
                        broader trend within digital art where the boundaries of art are continuously being expanded and redefined. With the ongoing advancements in AI and machine learning the 
                        technical intricacies involved in the process of producing net/web art are further demonstrated. Pruijt (2006) sheds light on the "social interaction" dynamics within 
                        computer interfaces, which are pivotal in enhancing user engagement with digital artworks (Pruijt, 2006). The interactive elements integrated within "out_4_pizza" serve 
                        as an example of this as they allow for a more dynamic viewing experience that evolves based on viewer interaction showing the shift from static forms of art to a 
                        participatory form of art.
                    </p>
                    <p>"out_4_pizza" underlines the internet’s role not just as a platform for displaying and sharing art, but as a fundamental component of the artistic process and experience. 
                        "out_4_pizza" has the spirit of early web experiments, where artists explored the possibilities of digital canvases connecting the project to the legacy of pioneering 
                        digital art, demonstrating a lineage that is critical for understanding its placement within the broader art history. Looking towards the future, the exploration and 
                        boundary pushing seen in "out_4_pizza" could signal new directions in how art is created and consumed with the increasing accessibility of AI and machine learning tools 
                        to the public may lead to more sophisticated forms of interactive art, where viewers not only see art but influence and change it in real-time allowing for democratised 
                        art creation, enabling more people to participate in artistic processes and blurring the lines between artist and audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>I enjoyed exploring "out_4_pizza" and the profound impact of the internet on artistic expression in reshaping and transcending traditional boundaries in art. Brothers’ 
                        implementation of her artworks on out4pizza.com not only highlight the internet's role as a medium but also an integral and interactive part of the creative process.  
                        I believe that "out_4_pizza" is a good example of computational creativity that showcases how technology can co-create and reshape viewer interactions not only enriching 
                        the aesthetic experience but also challenging our perceptions of artistry and urging us to consider a future where art in never “complete” or static but continuously 
                        evolving with technological advancements. I feel that "out_4_pizza" is a visionary and intriguing project that leverages the unique capabilities of the internet to foster 
                        interactive, dynamic, and participatory art experiences, which displays a significant evolution in how art is both viewed and valued.

            <h1>Net/Web Art Rationale</h1> 
            <p>Inspired by out4pizza.com I set out to create a Net/Web artwork similar to those displayed on that site while adding my own twist to it and keeping it inline with my website's theme of renaissance statues. And so I chose to incorporate an image of Perseus with Medusa's head into the artwork. My primary focus was to create the moiré effect present in many of out4pizza’s posts as well as their distinctly trippy and abstract nature.</p>
            <p>The moiré effect is what makes this into an interactive Net/Web artwork and not just an image on the internet as when the user scrolls or resizes the page the colours and patterns displayed on the artwork will change allowing the viewer the ability to interact with and change how my artwork is displayed in a unique and dynamic way. The moiré effect also relies on the monitor that it is being displayed on so one viewer may not see the same effects as another user does.</p>
            <p>To create the moiré effect I worked in Krita where I created horizontal and vertical line patterns. I then messed around with these patterns by tilting, warping and resizing them until I got the desired effect. Then I layered each of these patterns upon each other creating the wavy pattern seen on the artwork.</p>
            <p>For the image at the centre of the artwork, I extensively edited it in photoshop where I sharpened and pixelated much of it and then manually removed small blocks of the image whilst keeping some lines in a pattern which at first glance looks rather random and abstract. For this I did not just want to include black but a whole palette of different colours giving the artwork a “glitchy” and uniquely digital look to it. Additionally I added lines of yellow radiating out from Medusa's head to enhance the visual impact.</p>
            <p>The title I chose for this artwork is “Autosarcophagy of Ego”. In order to understand this, I will break down these words. "Auto-" is a prefix meaning "self." "Sarcophagy" comes from the Greek words "sarx" (flesh) and "phagein" (to eat), which together mean "flesh-eating" or "cannibalism." In psychological terms, the "ego" refers to the self, particularly one's sense of identity and self-importance.</p>
            <p>I aimed to transform the meaning of the statue of Perseus with Medusa's head to a one conveying a theme of self-destruction or self-sabotage, where one's ego is being consumed from within. Inner conflict between different aspects of one's identity, where the ego is in a constant struggle with itself, leading to a metaphorical cannibalism. In my artwork Perseus and Medusa symbolise the ego and the self respectively.</p>
